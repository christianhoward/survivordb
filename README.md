# survivordb
A personal project for the TV show Survivor. This website was built around the idea of looking up information about various Surviror players while not spoiling any unwatched seasons of the show. The project has been put on hold due to data collection, but the hope is to resume in spring 2017.

## Technologies Used
- Django/Python
- PostgreSQL
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS

## Decisions
I chose to use Django as the web framework because I had enjoyed working with the framework in the Djangogirls and official Django documentation tutorials and wanted to expand my knowledge on it. Once I am able to collect all the relevant data, I will look to implementing more features, including search, into the website.
