# survivordb
A personal project for the TV show Survivor. This website was built around the idea of looking up information about various Surviror players while not spoiling any unwatched seasons of the show. The project has been put on hold due to data collection.

## Technologies Used
- Django/Python
- PostgreSQL
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS

## Decisions
I chose to use Django as the web framework because I had enjoyed working with the framework in the Djangogirls and official Django documentation tutorials and wanted to expand my knowledge on it.

## Questions??
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
